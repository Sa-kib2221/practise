         <p>Call of Duty is a first-person shooter military video game series</p> and media franchise published by 
            Activision, starting in 2003.<p> The games were first developed by Infinity Ward, then by Treyarch and 
            Sledgehammer Games. Several spin-off and handheld games</p> were made by other developers. The most recent, 
            Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, was released on October 25, 2024.[1] <p>The upcoming title, Call of Duty: Black
             Ops 7, is scheduled to be released in November 2025.</p> <p>The series originally focused on a World War II setting,<p> with Infinity 
                Ward developing Call of Duty (2003) and Call of Duty 2 (2005) and Treyarch developing</p> Call of Duty 3 (2006). Infinity 
                Ward's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare <p>(2007) introduced a modern setting and proved to <p>be the breakthrough title for the
